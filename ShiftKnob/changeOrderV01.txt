change order for BottomPCB_V01:

   
change order for TopPCB_V01:

1. add through holes for screws - DONE
2. rework silk screen with new dates - DONE
3. move entire PCB to be centered at (0.85,0.85) - DONE
4. move C1 to allow space for holes - DONE
5. change 6 pin connector to (2) 4 pin connectors - DONE

Completed Changes:

2. silkscreen for motor diode is backwards

3. 50ohm resistors on Red led of RGBs should be bumped 
   up to 100ohm

4. remove the power LED and resistor. These are 
   obsolete as the RGB LEDs turn on when 5V power is 
   applied

  a. remove 6 pin FTDI header
  b. add FTDI chip and connections to schematic



1. add bootloader programming pins to be used with 
   ICSP programmer (6 pin ICSP header) - ADDED TO SCHEMATIC

5. add FTDI chip to bottom of the board
  c. place chip on board after making space

6. add vertical USB connector to FTDI chip - ADDED TO SCHEMATIC

7. double check all capacitor locations and values and remove redundancies

8. is 12V connection really needed? Is Host-device power 
   enough? (possibly remove connector and 7805)

9. use right-angle RGB LEDs rather than surface mount ones -
   this will better shine light to the outside of the shift knob
   housing - ADDED TO SCHEMATIC
   
10. move RGB LEDs to the 6 o'clock, 2 o'clock, and 10 o'clock posistions

11. make center button a right angle button at the front of the shift knob.
- ADDED TO SCHEMATIC

12. add holes for screws
