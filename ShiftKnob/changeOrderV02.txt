BottomPCB:

1. TX/RX lines need to be switched - DONE
2. Label each component: 1, 2, 3, etc and generate a corresponding BOM


Big Changes:
1. Use an Arduino Pro Mini on the board
- minimize the number of connecting pins to allow more trace space.
- place FTDI chip on bottom
- will only need resistor arrays, MOSFETs, RGB LEDs, FTDI, ___
