change order for BottomPCB_V01:

1. add bootloader programming pins to be used with 
   ICSP programmer (6 pin ICSP header)
2. silkscreen for motor diode is backwards
3. 50ohm resistors on Red led of RGBs should be bumped 
   up to 100ohm
4. remove the power LED and resistor. These are 
   obsolete as the RGB LEDs turn on when 5V power is 
   applied
5. add FTDI chip to bottom of the board
6. add vertical USB connector
7. double check all capacitors and remove redundancies
8. is 12V connection really needed? Is Host-device power 
   enough? (possibly remove connector and 7805)
9. order different 16MHz oscillator with correct capacitor 
   values. Attempt to find the Arduino Pro Mini oscillator 
   or the Uno oscillator.
