OpenXC Shift Knob
=================

**ABOUT:** The Haptic Feedback Shift Knob is a manual transmission shift knob capable of sending haptic and 
visual signals to the driver. Using a built in algorithm, the Shift Knob determines when the driver 
should shift for best performance and then sends an appropriate haptic pulse through the driver's 
hand signalling that he or she should shift.

## Design Intent

The design intent of the Shift Knob hardware was to develop an embedded system that could receive input from a connected source and correctly energize a haptic feedback device (in this case a DC motor) based on the provided input. The PCBs were designed to easily fit within the physical constraints of a typical shift knob housing. In order to provide an open development platform and to allow future changes and new implementations, the hardware was based off the open source [Arduino] platform.  

## Layout

The Shift Knob PCBs were designed to be compact enough to fit within the physical constraints of a typical manual transmission [shift knob](https://github.com/openxc/shiftknob-3Ddesign). In order to provide enough space on the board, it was chosen to use circular PCBs with a diameter no greater than 38mm. The desired components could not easily fit on one PCB, so two PCBs were used to provide even more space and more flexibility. These two boards which are connected using two 4-pin headers have been cleverly named `TopPCB` and `BottomPCB`. Please refer to the [OpenXC Project Page] for pictures highlighting the design. Let's first take a look at the bottom PCB.

### Bottom PCB 

The core microcontroller is located on the Bottom PCB. The design is based off the [Arduino Pro Mini] running at 5V with a 16MHz oscillator. The Atemga328 communicates over USB through an on-board FTDI chip. 

**Main Components:**

* Atemega 328 (5V, 16MHz) 
* FT232RL FTDI serial chip
* 3 right angle RGB LEDs
* MOSFETs (to control LEDs and haptic feedback motor)
* Edge Button (for user input)
* 7805 5V regulator (if you choose to power from the 12V vehicle power)
* USB and header connectors

(see the BOM_TopPCB for more details and Digikey part numbers)

#### Top PCB

The Top PCB holds the 7 segment display and 8-bit shift register. The control follows the principles of this [tutorial](http://blog.makezine.com/2013/02/10/how-shift-registers-work/). The Top PCB and Bottom PCB communicate via 2 separate 4-pin header connections for a total of 8 pins. These pins are used to transmit power, ground, data communication to the shift register and also brightness control for the 7 segment display. The brightness of the 7 segment display is modulated by a P-Channel MOSFET on the Bottom PCB which regulates a PWM signal going to the common annode of the LEDs.

**Main Components:**

* [7-Segment display](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9191)
* 8-bit shift register (74HC595)

(see the BOM_BottomPCB for more details and Digikey part numbers)

## Bootloader

The Arduino [bootloader] can be easily flashed onto the Atmega328 using the detailed instructions from 
Arduino's website. There is a 2 by 3 pin header on the board to flash the bootloader over ISCP. If you have 
an Arduino Uno, you can load the ArduinoISP sketch onto the Arduino board and follow the instructions [here][bootloader].
